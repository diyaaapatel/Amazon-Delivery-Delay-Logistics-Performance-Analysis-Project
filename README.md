This project analyzes Amazon delivery performance and logistics efficiency by exploring how different factors such as traffic, weather, agent ratings, and geography impact delivery times. The analysis aims to identify bottlenecks, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction.

 Objectives

Understand delivery delay patterns across different traffic and weather conditions.

Compare on-time vs delayed delivery percentages.

Analyze customer agent ratings in relation to delivery performance.

Explore geographical distribution of delays using map visualizations.

Provide actionable insights through an interactive dashboard.
