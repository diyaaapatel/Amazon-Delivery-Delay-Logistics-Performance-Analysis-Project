This project analyzes Amazon delivery data to study delays, agent performance, and logistics efficiency. We performed data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and created KPIs such as on-time delivery rate, average delay, and SLA compliance. 

An interactive Power BI dashboard was built to visualize trends and provide insights into delivery performance. Python was used for data preprocessing and analysis, while SQL helped in structured querying and managing datasets.

What I did:

Cleaned and preprocessed Amazon delivery data using Python (Pandas, NumPy).

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in delivery delays and agent performance.

Designed and tracked KPIs such as on-time delivery rate, SLA compliance, and average delay.

Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize logistics performance and extract insights(Ongoing).

Applied SQL for structured querying and efficient data handling.
