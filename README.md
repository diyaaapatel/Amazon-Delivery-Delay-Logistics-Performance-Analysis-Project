#  Amazon Delivery Delay and Logistics Analysis  

##  Project Overview  
This project analyzes **Amazon delivery performance and logistics efficiency** by exploring how different factors such as **traffic, weather, agent ratings, and geography** impact delivery times. The goal is to identify bottlenecks, optimize operations, and enhance customer satisfaction.  

##  Objectives  
- Understand **delivery delay patterns** across different traffic and weather conditions.  
- Compare **on-time vs delayed delivery percentages**.  
- Analyze **customer agent ratings** in relation to delivery performance.  
- Explore **geographical distribution** of delays using map visualizations.  
- Provide actionable insights through an **interactive dashboard**.  

##  Dashboard Highlights  
The Power BI dashboard includes:  
- **44K Total Orders** analyzed.  
- **Delivery Performance:** 49% on-time vs 51% delayed.  
- **Average Delivery Time:** 124.9 minutes.  
- **Traffic Impact:** Deliveries take longest during **traffic jams (147 mins)**.  
- **Weather Impact:** Delays are higher in **foggy and cloudy conditions**.  
- **Monthly Trend:** Delivery time decreased from **126 mins in Feb → 124 mins in April**.  
- **Category-wise Orders:** Even distribution across **Electronics, Books, Jewelry, Grocery, Apparel**, etc.  
- **Geo Analysis:** Map visualization of delays across drop locations.
